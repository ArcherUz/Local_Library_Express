# Express web framework based on Node.js/Javascript #
I followed a online tutorial to develop a website to manage the catalog for a local library.
### It includes: ###
#### Use the Express Application Generator tool to create a skeleton website and application. ####
#### Start and stop the Node web server. ####
#### Use a database to store your application's data. ####
#### Create routes for requesting different information, and templates ("views") to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser. ####
#### Work with forms. ####
#### Deploy your application to production. ####
